# CIS25-Midterm

Part 1: calculateArea function multiplies the two parameters given to return the area of a rectangle. isPrime function checks to see if its parameter is divisible by any number smaller than it. If not, it is prime.

Part 2: Uses a for loop to print every even number from 2 to 50. The counter variable "i" increases by two each iteration. Then, an array is created with 10 zeros. A while loop checks to see if the last number in the array is a zero. While it is, the user is asked to input a number that will replace one of the zeros in the array until there are no more.

Part 3: The user is asked for their name, age, and favorite number. The answers are displayed in a sentence about the user. Then an integer variable, a float variable, a character variable, and a string variable are all declared, initialized, and displayed.

Part 4: The user is asked for three numbers, and nested if statements are used to find out which number is the biggest. Then, the user is asked to input a year. The program checks if the year is a leap year by seeing if it is divisible by four.

Part 5: It is a simple calculator. It asks the user for two numbers. Then, the user has the choice to either add, subtract, multiply, or divide the two numbers. A switch case is used to decide between the four options.

Part 6: The program checks to see if a given number (10) is equal to 20, which it is not. Then, a for loop is used to print every number from 0 to 5.
